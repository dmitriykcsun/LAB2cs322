This is a submission of lab 2 for Dmitriy Khristoforov for CSUN cs322 spring 2020. Project consists of two parts, launch and tube, command line tools that use fork() and execve() to execute commands. 

Launch runs the command supplied after "./launch" such as ".launch /bin/ls".

Tube runs two commands supplied after it with a pipe from the first command putting stdout into the stdin of the second command such as, "./tube /bin/ls -l , /bin/cat".
